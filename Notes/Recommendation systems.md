## Recommendation Systems

## Popularity and likes
This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in instagram.
When you click that heart, instagram records it, and based on info it has on you, it might suggest that to someone else that is similar to you.

We created the fav bubble tea service which is based on the popularity/likes paradigm of recommendation services.

## N-point rating systems

N-point rating systems are used by many services, but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is Amazon's main purchasing service.
