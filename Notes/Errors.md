# Syntax Errors  

These types of errors are the ones where you run your code and something breaks.

Syntax errors are relatively easy to fix.

Syntax errors happen when we don't follow the rules completely.

Some examples are when we forget a closing ". 

Or if we're missing a closing parenthesis.>Syntax <=> Rules
# Semantic Errors  

Semantic errors are much more challenging (in Ubial's opinion) to squash.

## .Lower()


## .upper()
The .upper() method uppercases all the le
## .strip()
The .strip() method removes characters from both the the beginning and the end of the string. 

```python
user_feeling = input ("How are you feeling today?")

if user_feeling = "good"
if user_feeling.lower().strip("") == "good":
	print("That's great!")
```

## .split(str)

The .split(str) method splits a string into a list, separating the string based on the character you give it.

```python
grocery_list = "eggs milk cheese hotwheels"

grocery_list = grocery_str.splt(" ")
```
