A list in python is a collection of items 
We can store different values in a list
Order matters in a list
# Creating a list
TO make a list we brackets[/] to surround our list 
We separate out the items using

```python 
some_list = ["John", "Tim", "Sara"]
```

# Access Elements in a list
We can grab things from list s using the bracket notation
In our examples above, if I wanted to access "Tim" , I would do the following

```python
some_list[1] # "Tim"
```
