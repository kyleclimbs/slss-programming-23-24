# Natural Language Processing

## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen.
We use the `print` function to display the output.

```Python 
print("your text goes here")
```

# Headers

## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by python.
This means the text is ignored.
We use the # symbol to make comments.
